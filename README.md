## Common Test I. Simulating Superfluid Dark Matter (DM) with PyAutoLens
Task: Modify and/or use the already existing functionality of PyAutoLens to simulate strong lensing from superfluid dark matter. Specifically, you will need to simulate the effects of lensing from a linear mass density - imagine this being a string of mass on galactic scales.

## Specific Test IV. Exploring Equivariant Neural Networks
Task: Use an Equivariant Neural Network of your choice to build a robust and efficient model for binary classification or unsupervised anomaly detection on the provided dataset. In the case of unsupervised anomaly detection, train your model to learn the distribution of the provided strong lensing images with no substructure. Please implement your approach in PyTorch and discuss your strategy.
